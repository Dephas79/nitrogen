# Nitrogen Web Framework for Erlang

Nitrogen is an Erlang-based web framework that allows you to develop
infinitely scaleable, Ajax-rich web applications using a pure Erlang 
technology stack.

See the [Nitrogen Project website](http://nitrogenproject.com) for
additional information.

## Upgrading from Nitrogen 2 to Nitrogen 3?

If you are using a Nitrogen 2 structured project, run the following command
from the root of your Nitrogen 2-based project.

**WARNING: Make sure you commit to version control before running this - it will change your working directory heavily**

**WARNING 2: Running scripts directly from the internet is dumb. Review the code of this script before you run it. But if you really want to do it this way, here you go. **

```bash
curl -S https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nitrogen/nitrogen/rebar3/scripts/convert_to_rebar3.sh | bash
```

## Getting Started

Follow the tutorial at
[http://nitrogenproject.com/doc/tutorial.html](http://nitrogenproject.com/doc/tutorial.html)

## Building Nitrogen on Linux and OSX

The [Getting Started](http://nitrogenproject.com/doc/index.html#sec-3) guide covers this.

## Building Nitrogen on FreeBSD

Install Erlang from 

Make sure you have `gmake` installed, and use `gmake` instead of `make`

Example:

$ gmake rel_cowboy

## Building Nitrogen on Windows

Instructions for building on windows can be found in [rel/overlay/win](https://github.com/nitrogen/nitrogen/blob/master/rel/overlay/win/README.md)

## Upgrading from Rebar2 to Rebar3?

If you have a Nitrogen project generated by the `make slim_X` or `make rel_X` commands, run this from the root of your project to convert that project to rebar3:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nitrogen/nitrogen/rebar3/scripts/convert_to_rebar3.sh | bash
```

### Concerned about running scripts directly from the internet?

You can download the script directly, or you can manually make the changes.
